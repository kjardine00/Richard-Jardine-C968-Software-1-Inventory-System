This is my submission for BFM1 — BFM1 TASK 1: OBJECT-ORIENTED APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

This projects requirements did not include intializing a set of data within the project. However, I created a method within Inventory for testing and debugging. 

The Method LoadFakeData() can be used to insert a set of data to test the functionality of my project. To use LoadFakeData() uncomment the following lines:

MainScreen.cs > Line 18
Inventory.cs > Lines 19 - 61
